# Group 3 UAS Wing Optimization

AIAA Hands-on Demo - Optimize a UAV wing design to meet system requirements.

## Quick Start

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jdilla-istari/group3-uas-demo/blob/main/group3_uas_optimization.ipynb)

## Overview

You've been brought onto a project with a failing aircraft design. The current wing configuration exceeds the weight budget, leaving insufficient payload capacity.

**Your Task:** Modify the wing geometry parameters to achieve a design that meets all requirements while minimizing structure weight.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Structure Weight | ≤ 275 lb |
| Payload Capacity | ≥ 125 lb |
| Range | ≥ 1,000 nm |
| Cruise Speed | ≥ 100 kts |

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Enter your Istari PAT and name
3. Adjust wing parameters using the sliders
4. Run the analysis
5. Iterate to find the lowest weight design that passes all requirements

## Competition

The team with the **lowest structure weight** that meets all requirements wins!
